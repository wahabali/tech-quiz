    "question": "A domain admin sets a domain-level default sensitivity label. Later, a Fabric item with an existing label is updated. Under which condition will the domain-level label override the existing one?",
    "options": [
      "If the existing label was manually applied with a lower priority",
      "If the existing label was automatically applied and had a higher priority",
      "If the existing label was automatically applied and had a lower priority",
      "If the existing label was manually applied regardless of priority"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Domain-level default sensitivity labels override existing labels only if the existing label was automatically applied and has a lower priority. Manually applied labels or higher-priority labels are preserved.",

    "question": "What happens if you apply a mandatory labeling policy in Microsoft Fabric for supported items?",
    "options": [
      "Users can skip labeling if they use APIs.",
      "Users must label all items, including RDL and Scorecards.",
      "Users must label all supported items before saving or editing them.",
      "Users can import .pbix files without applying labels."
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Mandatory labeling policies enforce that users must label supported items before saving or editing them. However, RDL, Scorecards, and some others are excluded, and APIs/service principals are not affected.",

      "Configure workspace-level certifiers",
      "Enable default labeling at the workspace level"

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "To override tenant settings, domain-level certification must be explicitly enabled, and certifiers must be assigned within the domain settings.",
